# stdio_socket

Expose a process stdio to a unix socket

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

Source          | <https://github.com/epics-containers/stdio-socket>
:---:           | :---:
PyPI            | `pip install stdio-socket`
Releases        | <https://github.com/epics-containers/stdio-socket/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from stdio_socket import __version__

print(f"Hello stdio_socket {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m stdio_socket --version
```
